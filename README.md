# Customer-segmentation
This project aims to segment a bank's customer base to provide personalized services, reduce churn, and increase product offerings through targeted marketing. By applying clustering techniques (specifically K-Means) on customer data, the bank can better understand customer behavior and tailor its marketing strategies accordingly.

Key goals of the project:

Segment customers into distinct groups based on their financial behavior and demographics.
Provide business recommendations for each customer segment to optimize product offerings, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce churn.
Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis consists of customer details such as:

Age, balance, duration of engagement with the bank.
Demographics such as job type, marital status, and education.
Whether they subscribed to a term deposit after the bank's marketing campaign

Key Features:
age, balance, duration, campaign, pdays, previous: Numerical features representing the customer's interaction with the bank.
job, marital, education, default, housing, loan, contact, poutcome, month: Categorical features representing customer demographics and financial situation.
Problem Statement
How can a bank effectively segment its customer base to offer personalized services, reduce churn, and increase product offerings through targeted marketing?

This project uses K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer segments, which can then be used to target different customer needs and preferences.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Missing values were handled, and categorical features were encoded using OneHotEncoder.
The data was scaled using StandardScaler to ensure that all features contributed equally to the clustering process.
Dimensionality Reduction:

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was applied to reduce the feature space, making it easier to visualize and work with the data.
Clustering:

K-Means Clustering was performed on the PCA-transformed data. The optimal number of clusters was determined using the Elbow Method and validated using the Silhouette Score.
Cluster Analysis:

The clusters were analyzed based on their average numeric values (age, balance, duration, etc.) and most frequent categorical attributes (job type, marital status, etc.).
Visualizations were created to provide insights into how different clusters behave.

Results
Clustering Findings:
After applying PCA and clustering, we identified 3 distinct customer segments:
Cluster 0: Customers with moderate balance and frequent past interactions with the bank.
Cluster 1: High balance customers who are less engaged.
Cluster 2: Younger, low-balance customers who are not very engaged with the bank.

Silhouette Score:
The average Silhouette Score for the clustering was approximately 0.4, indicating moderate clustering quality. While the clusters are reasonably well-separated, there is room for further improvement.
Future adjustments may include refining the data preprocessing steps, experimenting with different numbers of clusters, or exploring alternative clustering algorithms (such as DBSCAN or Agglomerative Clustering) to further enhance the results.

Visualizations:
Bar plots were created to show the average balance, age, duration, and pdays for each cluster, providing insights into customer behavior patterns.

Technologies Used
Python: Primary language for the analysis.
Jupyter Notebook: Environment for developing and running the code.
scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms such as K-Means and PCA.
Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.

Conclusion
This project successfully segmented the bank's customers into distinct groups based on their financial and demographic characteristics. By leveraging these segments, the bank can offer personalized services, enhance customer satisfaction, and reduce churn.
