# Customer-segmentation
This project aims to segment a bank's customer base to provide personalized services, reduce churn, and increase product offerings through targeted marketing. By applying clustering techniques (specifically K-Means) on customer data, the bank can better understand customer behavior and tailor its marketing strategies accordingly.

Key goals of the project:

Segment customers into distinct groups based on their financial behavior and demographics.
Provide business recommendations for each customer segment to optimize product offerings, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce churn.
Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis consists of customer details such as:

Age, balance, duration of engagement with the bank.
Demographics such as job type, marital status, and education.
Whether they subscribed to a term deposit after the bank's marketing campaign
